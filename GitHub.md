## Introduction

* GitHub is an online Git-repository manager. While I was preparing the materials for GitHub, I found that the **Introduction to GitHub** provides a good learning by doing tutorial.

## Reminder

* The tutorial provides the actions that you can take on GitHub. You should also learn how to execute the commands through the Git tool. See the Git Cheat Sheet below.
